Basic K-means
======

A very basic implementation of K-means clustering for a pre-determined dataset.

This was an assignment for Intro to Business Data Analytics with Professor Pradeep Ravikumar. The assignment was to do a K=2 clustering of customers in the bankdata.csv file, ignoring the pep column. The we analyzed if K-means provided any useful information about customers with pep=1 vs. pep=0.

This is my first R program, so it is a bit rough around the edges. Like most R users, I am self-taught. The class had no R instruction. The plotting bit at the end is especially lacking. But I think this is good work for a first R program, and the implementation of K-means is legitimate, if primitive and inflexible. There were some 'bad' decisions made as part of the assignment, and these are detailed in the comments.
