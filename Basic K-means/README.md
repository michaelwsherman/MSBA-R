Basic K-means
======

A very basic implementation of K-means clustering for a pre-defined dataset. An obvious toy assignment, but useful for making sure you know the algorithm.

This was an assignment for Intro to Business Data Analytics with Professor Pradeep Ravikumar. The assignment was to do a K=2 clustering of customers in the bankdata.csv file, ignoring the pep column. Then we discussed if K-means provided any useful information about customers with pep=1 vs. pep=0.

This is my first R program, I have improved. The plotting bit at the end is especially lacking. But I think this is good work for a first R program, and the implementation of K-means is legitimate, if primitive and inflexible. There were some 'bad' decisions intentionally made as part of the assignment, and these are detailed in the comments.
